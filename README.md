# Eisenhower-Matrix

[Click here](https://shabnamrahmed.github.io/eisenhower-matrix/) to check out the application! 

This is a single page application implementation of [The Eisenhower Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method) which can be used to organize and prioritize your tasks based on Importance and Urgency.

## Motivation :bulb:

Although there are many websites/apps out there to help you organize your tasks, many of them require creating an account or a payment.  This Eisenhower Matrix app requires neither and stores data directly in your browser allowing anyone to take advantage of it immediately.  It was very helpful in organizing my projects and classwork, and I hope others can benefit from it as well.

## Details :memo:

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45129081/77263408-a04fad00-6c6e-11ea-8690-89d8b94cba9d.png" width="640" height="480"/></p>

Recommended actions for each category are:

 - **Important/Urgent** - do immediately

 - **Important/~~Urgent~~** - schedule to do later

 - **~~Important~~/Urgent** - delegate to someone else

 - **~~Important/Urgent~~** - eliminate

## Features :sparkles:

Clicking the Save button will store the data to your browser's local storage so that they can be retrieved later.  Refreshing the page will load the last stored set of entries.  Currently only one set of entries can be saved and will be overwritten on subsequent saves. 

Clicking the Download button will convert the data to a `.txt` file with each of the matrix box's entries separated by a line and each entry separated by a `|` character and download it to your computer.  

## Upcoming Features :construction:

 - Upload a file
 - Store multiple copies
 - Hook up Google Drive API
 - Give user option to add more inputs to each box
 - Template examples
