[Click here](https://shabnamrahmed.github.io/eisenhower-matrix/) to check out the application.  

This is a single page application implementation of [The Eisenhower Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method) which can be used to organize and prioritize your tasks based on Importance and Urgency.

## Motivation

Although there are many websites/apps out there to help you organize your tasks, many of them require creating an account or a payment.  This Eisenhower Matrix app requires neither and stores data directly in your browser allowing anyone to take adavantage of it immediately.  It was very helpful in organizing my projects and classowrk, and I hope others can benefit from it as well.

Recommended actions for each category are:

 - **Important/Urgent** - do immediately

 - **Important/~~Urgent~~** - schedule to do later

 - **~~Important~~/Urgent** - delegate to someone else

 - **~~Important/Urgent~~** - eliminate
